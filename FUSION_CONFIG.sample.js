  // for more customization.

  // SIMPLE CONFIG BASED FIELD DISPLAY
  //
  // This is the simpler option, but wont look as good.
  // It creates a list of field names next to field results
  // in the format of:
  // field label: field result
  //
  // In order to add items to the list you must add the fields to
  // fields_to_display. You can change the label of any field by adding a
  // field mapping in field_display_labels. You can optionally use a wildcard '*'
  // to display all fields.
  //
  // FLEXIBLE HTML FIELD DISPLAY
  //
  // For more advanced layouts edit the document template this provides a great
  // deal of flexibility and allows you to add more complex logic to your results.
  // You are able to use basic javascript to show hide, or alter the display of
  // any or multiple results.
